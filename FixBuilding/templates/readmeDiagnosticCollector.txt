Software AG has created this diagnostic collector in order to gather diagnostic 
information from your system. The diagnostic information collected will help 
Software AG identify the problem. 

Software AG strongly recommends applying this diagnostic collector in an 
isolated test environment where the reported problem can be reproduced. 
Software AG may suggest that such a diagnostic collector be applied in a 
production environment under well-considered circumstances. 

Diagnostic collectors may generate a significant amount of data. Therefore the 
logging target should not be in a location where this data accumulation could 
lead to a problem.
